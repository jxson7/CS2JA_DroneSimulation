# CS2JA16_DroneSimulation
The following project has been developed by Jason Jay Dookarun at the University of Reading, as part of a Java coursework. The aim of this
project is to provide a user with a simulation of adding an element within an arena. This element is represented as a drone. Throughout 
later stages of the program, a GUI is to be developed to provide the user with an enhanced version of this illustration.
