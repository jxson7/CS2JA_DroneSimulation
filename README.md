# CS2JA16_DroneSimulation
The following project has been developed by Jason Jay Dookarun at the University of Reading, as part of a Java coursework. The aim of this
project is to provide a user with a simulation of adding an element within an arena. This element is represented as a drone. This existing branch,
currently being accessed contains a Graphical User Interface edition of the project.

To access the program, using your terminal, enter "java -jar DroneGUI.jar", to execute the runnable .jar file.

Thank you!
